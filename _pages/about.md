I am a Senior at New York University Abu Dhabi, majoring in Computer Science and Interactive Media.

As a software developer, I enjoy building innovative solutions to complex problems using my skills and expertise. I am passionate about technology and constantly seek to improve my knowledge and skills in various programming languages and frameworks. My love for coding drives me to constantly experiment and explore new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.

Outside of the scope of coding, I enjoy playing volleyball, football, tennis, and chess.
