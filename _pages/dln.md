As a 22-year-old senior at New York University Abu Dhabi, studying Computer Science and Interactive Media, I embarked on a transformative journey by enrolling in an introductory course in digital humanities. This experience was particularly enriching due to the diverse group of classmates who joined me, spanning majors from Interactive Media to Literature and Creative Writing. Together, we delved into digital literacy, each contributing our unique strategies and skills to the classroom.

Before this course, I had already developed a strong foundation in coding, utilizing languages such as Python and Java for projects like NotParkour and leading frontend development for a dynamic web tool at NYU Abu Dhabi as a Research Assistant. My academic journey has been characterized by problem-solving, algorithm design, and leveraging platforms like GitHub for collaborative coding.

My peers from various disciplines brought their own digital prowess into the mix. For instance, Interactive Media students demonstrated excellence in user-centered design, Film and New Media enthusiasts explored multimedia production, while Business and Marketing students applied data analytics for market analysis. Together, we discovered that content creation and digital humanities work transcended traditional boundaries, enabling us to produce interactive websites, digital art installations, and immersive narratives.

The course highlighted the importance of computational thinking and data literacy across all disciplines, equipping us with skills essential for navigating the digital age and harnessing AI's potential. We engaged in interdisciplinary collaboration, using platforms like Slack and Discord for idea exchange and project collaboration, which proved to be a catalyst for creativity and innovative thinking.

Reflecting on our journey, we contemplated the ethical implications of AI within our fields, from the responsibilities of AI developers to the impact of AI-generated content on storytelling and environmental monitoring. Looking forward, we are excited to continue exploring new interdisciplinary approaches, fostering innovation, and pushing the boundaries of our fields.

In conclusion, this journey through digital humanities has been transformative, broadening my horizons and bridging the gap between technology and the humanities. It has equipped me with a multifaceted understanding of digital literacy, preparing me to embrace the challenges and opportunities of the digital age with an interdisciplinary mindset.
