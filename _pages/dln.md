### Part 1: Introduction

As a 22-year-old university student, I embarked on a transformative journey by enrolling in an introductory course in digital humanities. What made this experience particularly enriching was the diverse group of classmates who joined me. Our majors spanned a wide spectrum of disciplines, including Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing. Being such a diverse group, all of us had different opinions on what digital humanities represented.

Coming from a Computer Science background, I had a foundation in programming languages like Python and JavaScript and experience in software development, ranging from mobile apps to web games. My academic path has been characterized by engaging in group projects, which taught me to adapt to and learn from different workflow styles. My roles have varied from being a Research Assistant at NYUAD to a Software Engineering intern at Yandex and leading the Adal Volunteers Club in Kazakhstan. These experiences refined my leadership and teamwork skills, underscoring the value of collective endeavor and shared objectives. My academic projects not only demonstrated my technical prowess but also my ability to creatively solve problems by synthesizing diverse perspectives.

My peers from Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing had their digital toolkits. Interactive Media students excelled in user-centered design and interactive storytelling, often utilizing software like Adobe Creative Suite. Film and New Media enthusiasts delved into multimedia production and digital narrative creation. Environmental Studies majors leveraged data analysis software for environmental research, while Business and Marketing students honed their skills in data analytics platforms for market analysis. Students in Literature and Creative Writing dived deep into research databases to fuel their literary and artistic pursuits.

The digital humanities course illuminated how our varied disciplines intersect in the digital realm. We discovered the multidisciplinary potential of content creation, from interactive websites and digital art installations to immersive narratives and AI-generated content. This course introduced us to tools like Github, Markdown, Python, and APIs, which are invaluable for our future endeavors.

### Part 2: Digital Humanities and Diverse Perspectives

In the course, I learned how varied backgrounds shape our approaches to digital humanities projects. My background in Computer Science provided a solid foundation in programming and data analysis. I had a particular focus on Python and JavaScript for developing mobile and web applications. For example, I didn’t struggle with GitHub Pages, when others could have. Everyone had their own strong sides, and interestingly all of them were useful in the realm of Digital Humanities. This course helped us recognize how our varied disciplines intersect in the digital realm. We explored the potential of interactive content creation through tools like Github, Markdown, Python, and APIs. This collective learning experience bridged gaps between technology and the humanities.

### Part 3: Exploring Digital Platforms and Tools

#### Markdown Note-taking

This year, I shifted exclusively to using Markdown for note-taking. After experimenting with platforms such as Notion, Taio, and Notes, I discovered Obsidian. It allowed me to write personal notes in Markdown and store them locally, addressing privacy concerns associated with cloud storage. Obsidian's built-in features, like local graph views, coupled with community support, made it a game-changer for managing my notes.

Currently, I use Obsidian for:

- **Note-taking:** Writing, organizing, and searching for personal notes efficiently.
- **Day/Week Planning:** Planning tasks and deadlines with daily/weekly notes.
- **Reading and Annotating PDFs:** Annotating articles and papers directly within the platform.

#### Collaborative Spaces like Discord

Social interaction and collaboration evolved with platforms like Discord. I use Discord to talk to friends, follow communities, and talk to people in those communities. For example, most communication in Interactive Media classes happens on the NYUADIM Discord server. Each class had its section, and a recreational chat was dedicated to memes. Debbie Chachra’s article, _"Why I Am Not a Maker,"_ challenges the overemphasis on making at the expense of caregiving and other roles. This resonates with my use of Discord for collaboration, where educators and learners can exchange ideas and support each other.

Discord's features made it ideal for collaboration:

- **Text and Voice Channels:** Channels dedicated to specific projects or topics facilitated focused discussions.
- **Flexibility and Customization:** The ability to create custom channels, roles, and bots provided flexibility.
- **Informal Communication:** The relaxed environment encouraged creative idea-sharing, leading to productive collaborations.

In the digital humanities context, a dedicated Discord server would be beneficial for:

- **Cross-Class Collaboration:** Encouraging students from different classes to share insights and resources.
- **Project Management:** Organizing projects with dedicated channels for different teams.
- **Resource Sharing:** A centralized location for sharing useful articles, tools, and tutorials.

These platforms and tools have transformed my approach to digital projects, streamlining note-taking and enhancing collaboration.

### Part 4: Digital Projects Overview

During our class, I've had the chance to deepen my understanding of how digital tools can transform our approach to the humanities. Having already been introduced to tools like Voyant Tools, AntConc, and RStudio in my sophomore year, this course reminded me of their value. We tackled projects that made us dive into text analysis and visualization, pulling out themes and patterns from large texts that would be tough to spot just by reading. For example, using Voyant Tools, I could work through works to find recurring motifs and ideas, uncovering hidden layers within the text.

Whether it was analyzing textual data, exploring digital platforms like GitHub, or engaging with RStudio for data visualization, each assignment built on what I knew and pushed me into new territory. This blend of hands-on learning and critical thinking about digital tools in the humanities has not only sharpened my analytical skills but also broadened my perspective on how technology can enrich our understanding of human culture and creativity.

#### Project 1: Harvard Art Museum Digital Collection Analysis

In the [first project](https://karishev.github.io/assignment/first-assignment/), I explored the digital collections of the Harvard Art Museum to understand the impact of digitalization on art curation and appreciation. My task was to evaluate the museum's website interface for accessibility and user experience. While the platform was notably user-friendly, it lacked a crucial feature for connecting related artworks, which I identified as a missed opportunity for enhancing contextual exploration. This finding led me to propose a "related works" section to help viewers establish new historical links.

This project underscored the transformative potential of digital tools in making art history more accessible and engaging for a wider audience.

#### Project 2: Corpus Analysis of Fyodor Dostoevsky's Works

For this [project](https://karishev.github.io/assignment/second-assignment/), I chose a corpus of three novels by Fyodor Dostoevsky: _The Idiot_, _The Brothers Karamazov_, and _Crime and Punishment_. Using Voyant Tools, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, frequencies, and trends across the texts.

**Key Findings:**

- **The Idiot:** Central role of the Prince and narrative dynamics revolving around time and abrupt transitions.
- **The Brothers Karamazov:** Philosophical debates among the Karamazov brothers, revealing moral struggles.
- **Crime and Punishment:** Evolution of Sonia and Raskolnikov’s relationship, underpinning themes of redemption and moral struggle.

This project highlighted how digital tools can transform literary analysis, revealing hidden themes and patterns that enrich our understanding of classic texts.

#### Project 3: Spatial Data Assignment with the "Kazakhstan Defense Enterprise Directory, 1995"

For my [spatial data assignment](https://karishev.github.io/assignment/third-assignment/), I decided to work with the _Kazakhstan Defense Enterprise Directory, 1995_ as my primary source, mainly because I am Kazakh and have never seen such material. This directory is intriguing due to its comprehensive coverage of over 37 defense enterprises transitioning to civilian markets in post-Soviet Kazakhstan.

**Data Extraction and Modeling:**

- Used ChatGPT to extract key information from the directory and structured it in a Google Sheets document.
- Geocoded addresses using the "Geocode by Awesome Table" extension for Google Sheets.
- Enriched data with a classification column named 'Focus,' distinguishing enterprises as 'Civilian,' 'Military,' 'Hybrid,' or 'Unclassified.'

This spatial data project offered valuable insights into Kazakhstan's industrial landscape, highlighting the role of visualization in understanding economic and strategic analyses.
